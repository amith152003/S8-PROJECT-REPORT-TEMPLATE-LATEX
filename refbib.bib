	ABSTRACT = {Indoor mobile robot (IMR) motion control for e-SLAM techniques with limited sensors, i.e., only LiDAR, is proposed in this research. The path was initially generated from simple floor plans constructed by the IMR exploration. The path planning starts from the vertices which can be traveled through, proceeds to the velocity planning on both cornering and linear motion, and reaches the interpolated discrete points joining the vertices. The IMR recognizes its location and environment gradually from the LiDAR data. The study imposes the upper rings of the LiDAR image to perform localization while the lower rings are for obstacle detection. The IMR must travel through a series of featured vertices and perform the path planning further generating an integrated LiDAR image. A considerable challenge is that the LiDAR data are the only source to be compared with the path planned according to the floor map. Certain changes still need to be adapted into, for example, the distance precision with relevance to the floor map and the IMR deviation in order to avoid obstacles on the path. The LiDAR setting and IMR speed regulation account for a critical issue. The study contributed to integrating a step-by-step procedure of implementing path planning and motion control using solely the LiDAR data along with the integration of various pieces of software. The control strategy is thus improved while experimenting with various proportional control gains for position, orientation, and velocity of the LiDAR in the IMR.},

	abstract = {Nowadays simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of indoor mobile robots in unknown environment is very popular in robot research. Laser radar is widely used in SLAM research. In this paper, three 2D-SLAM algorithms based on laser radar in the robot operating system (ROS) were compared and evaluated, namely Gmapping, Hector-SLAM and Cartographer. It firstly built a mobile robot experimental platform based on ROS in the real environment. In order to reflect the ability of building maps by three SLAM algorithms, experiments were carried out in simple corridor and laboratory with many obstacles respectively. Meanwhile, ten points in the real environment were selected to measure the distance on maps and the real distance obtained by laser range finder for comparison and error analysis. Finally, according to the experimental results, strengths and weaknesses of each SLAM algorithm were discussed. It is concluded that Gmapping has the highest mapping accuracy in simple small scene environment while Hector-slam is more suitable for a long corridor environment, and Cartographer has more advantages in complex environment.},
