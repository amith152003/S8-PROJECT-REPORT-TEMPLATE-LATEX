\section{\fontsize{14}{16} Working Principle}
{
	\fontsize{12}{14}
	The RAVENâ€™s working principle is a combination of particulate processes which involves:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data Acquisition:} The UGV improves situational awareness by using depth cameras
		and LiDAR to collect environmental data, ensuring precise navigation and effective
		obstacle detection through continuous sensor data acquisition.
		
		\item \textbf{Data Transmission:} Utilize the DDS provided by ROS2 for reliable and efficient data
		sharing, while establishing strong wireless connections to enable remote control and
		real-time tracking.
		
		\item \textbf{Localization:} Integrate depth camera and LiDAR data to enhance the robot's
		perception of its surroundings, and employ SLAM to create dynamic maps and localize
		the robot within them.
		
		\item \textbf{Data Storage:} While navigating, temporarily store data for quick processing, and keep
		sensor data and maps for future use and analysis.
		
		\item \textbf{Analysis and Visualization:} Utilize programs like rViz2 to visualize the robot's current
		state, surroundings, and mapping progress, while analyzing sensor data to identify and
		classify obstacles for informed navigation.
		
		\item \textbf{Path Planning:} Use Nav2 for dynamic path planning, enabling real-time navigation
		around obstacles, and implementing decision-making algorithms to adapt to complex
		environments and meet operational goals.
		
		\item \textbf{Feedback and Control:}  Implement feedback systems to refine navigation for seamless
		operation, utilizing real-time sensor data to prevent collisions with both static and
		dynamic obstacles.
		
		\item \textbf{User Interaction:} Provide operators with a user interface to monitor environmental
		data and the robot's status, while allowing manual control when necessary to enhance
		flexibility and manage challenging tasks.
		
		\item \textbf{Safety Mechanisms:} Implement immediate stop features for safety in the event of
		detected anomalies, and use real-time sensor data to proactively avoid collisions during
		navigation.
	\end{itemize}
	
	To function, the UGV gathers real-time data from depth and LiDAR cameras, which are then
	relayed and analyzed to provide quick insights. GPS and odometry improve localization, and
	SLAM creates dynamic maps. Effective path planning is supported by NAV2, and real-time
	modifications are possible thanks to feedback systems. Through emergency procedures and
	power management, user features provide safety while enabling manual control and
	monitoring.
